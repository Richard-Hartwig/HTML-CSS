                <article>
                    <p>The Hardware R Us story began in South Florida when Author Grimes, part owner of the North Hardware Store Company, envisioned creating a chain of hardware stores.
                        Sales grew over time, and Hardware R Us stores opened in neighboring towns throughout South Florida.</p>
